# Origin
    I have been trying to learn on my own and started heavy with a Linux/Wayland/Vulkan combo in C++.  Trying to keep things simple I opted to go for anything CC0 or MIT licensed where I could.  One of the big problems with Linux is that libraries aren't unified between distributions and many contain BSD-like licenses I didn't really want to deal with. 

# What's Included?
    The first files I felt needed to be made were for an immediate mode UI and a 2D collision detection system.  These are meant to be used together, but are separated into their own folders so that I can add notes for anyone who is trying to learn C++ or to clarify the code without having walls of text in the comments.

# Requirements
    Safest bet is C++20 and clang at the moment.  I mostly used clang as I found the GCC defaults to be overly pedantic, even with some warnings turned off.
